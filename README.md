# REWARDS ARCADE

Reimagining the Customer Experience through Gamified Rewards


## 🧠Problem Statement

After a purchase, most shopping apps miss a key moment to engage customers. Traditional reward systems are passive, forgettable, and lack excitement. We wanted to make post-checkout interactions more fun, meaningful, and habit-forming.
## 💡Our Solution

We built a Gamified Checkout Experience for Walmart using ReactJS and CSS.

After each purchase, users are offered a chance to play a quick, engaging game:

🎰 Slot Machine

❓ Trivia Quiz

🥚 Shell Game

### Rewards:
Win: Earn coupons, digital rewards, or extra points

Lose: Receive a small consolation prize (e.g., 5 points)

Rewards are automatically added to the Walmart Wallet, ready to redeem anytime.
